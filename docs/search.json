One such challenge is to reconstruct the spatiotemporal variation of ocean sound speed profile (SSP) from acoustic observations between source-receiver pairs. This problem can be formulated as a parameter inversion problem related to a dynamic forward model and is generally solved using linearized inversion of a ray-based model. We investigated the applicability of ML methods for this ocean acoustic tomography (OAT) problem. Two major challenges we faced for data-driven learning are limited empirical data and on-stationarity of SSP evolution. I approached these challenges by generating synthetic data utilizing prior knowledge of the SSP structure.\n\n  \n        \n          \n            Related publications:\n            \n              JASA 2022, \n            \n              JASA-EL 2025\n            \n          \n                    \n      \n    \n      \n        Thermal Modeling for Chip Design\n        \n  \n        \n          \n            Related publications:\n            \n              IEDM 2024\n            \n          \n                    \n      \n    \n         \n\n\n\n \nNo matching items"
