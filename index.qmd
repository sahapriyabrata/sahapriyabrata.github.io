<div class="about">

<p>
I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockwell Automation</a>, Austin, TX, where I work on integrating vision and control to advance industrial automation, leveraging generative AI and foundation models. Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at 
<a href="https://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia Tech</a>.
</p>

<p>
I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia Tech</a>
in 2023, and my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from <a href="https://www.iitkgp.ac.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IIT Kharagpur</a> in 2015. 
At Georgia Tech, I conducted research under <a href="https://greenlab.ece.gatech.edu/members/professor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Saibal Mukhopadhyay</a> on developing machine learning techniques for modeling and control of dynamical systems.

My research interests lie broadly in applied machine learning, with applications in scientific computing, robotics, and control. I work on developing ML models for complex physical processes, learning-based optimization and control, and intelligent sensing in autonomous systems.
